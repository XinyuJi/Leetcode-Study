Generic Leetcode Questions such as trapping rain water, median of two sorted lists, binary search tree implementation.  
1: High Five
2: HashMAp
3: 2 Sum, 3 Sum, 4 Sum  

Leetcode Easy Problem - High Five  
Hackerrank Medium level questions - Regular expression
// array is sorted in increasing order, but is rotated some spaces i.e. {6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} or {4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3}

1. Something similar to number of islands, but little more complexity added
2. Find the duplicate integer in an array.  
Codepad question:
1. Implement a Deque with some follow up on optimization part (solved with Doubly Linked List)
2. Given name and grades of students, print the name along with the maximum avg score
Hint: Similar to leetcode high five problem, but you need to print the highest avg score.
Can be solved using hashmap and taking running sum along with the counts
3. (Don't exactly remember) Given a named tuple, with intervals and price, print the lowest price between the intervals, based on the start and end time
I used heapq for this implementation
